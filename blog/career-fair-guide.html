        <article class="content-section" style="padding: 4rem 2rem; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
            <div class="container" style="max-width: 100%;">
                
                <div style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--text-dark);">
                    
                    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.7; color: var(--text-dark); margin-bottom: 2rem; font-weight: 500;">
                        When I was a freshman and a sophomore, I showed up at the career fair feeling extremely nervous, underprepared, and like an absolute imposter. Fast forward a couple of years, and after talking to dozens of accounting recruiters, I realized something important: they are just humans. If you follow these steps, the process will become significantly less daunting and much more productive.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">1. Understand Your Goals</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        At a career fair, you aren't necessarily going to walk away with a signed internship offer on the spot. Your goal is to introduce yourself, build rapport, and give yourself a head start over the competition.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        If you are a freshman, your goal should be to identify which Freshman Programs or leadership summits are available. Many firms don't hire freshman or sophomores as traditional interns right away, but they do offer two-day programs or early-insight opportunities. Participating in these puts you in an advanced pool of candidates when you eventually apply during your junior year.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">2. Approaching the Booth</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        It is the little things that make a recruiter remember you. In a crowd of hundreds of students, being well-put-together helps you stand out.
                    </p>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-left: 2rem;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Dress the Part:</strong> Wear business professional attire.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Body Language:</strong> Approach with a smile, make eye contact, and offer a firm handshake.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>The Opening:</strong> Lead with a clear introduction of your name.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">3. The Elevator Pitch</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        The easy option is to go to a recruiter and ask generic questions to let them do all the talking. However, it is much more professional to introduce yourself with a 30 to 60 second pitch.
                    </p>
                    <div style="background-color: var(--bg-light); border-left: 4px solid var(--primary-color); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
                        <p style="margin: 0; font-style: italic; color: var(--text-dark);">
                            For example: <em>Hi, my name is Joe Schmo. I am a sophomore here at Bentley University studying accounting. I recently worked as a bank teller, and I am now looking to secure an internship with a public accounting firm. I've been following your firm's growth in the Northeast, and I'd love to talk to you about upcoming opportunities.</em>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        This brief pitch demonstrates both professionalism and intention.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">4. Be Ready for Questions</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        The recruiter is naturally going to ask you a few qualifying questions. You should have an answer ready for:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-left: 2rem;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Audit or Tax?</strong> You don't need a twenty minute explanation, but you should show you have a basic concept of what these roles are and which one currently interests you more.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>The CPA Track:</strong> They will likely ask if you plan to become a CPA. Your best approach is to explain your specific plan for obtaining your 150 credits. This shows the recruiter that you are thinking long-term and are serious about the profession.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">5. Ask Intentional Questions</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        Have a few planned questions ready to keep the conversation flowing. Good examples include:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-left: 2rem;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">When are the internship application deadlines?</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">When are the new roles typically posted on the portal?</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">What opportunities are available for my specific year and GPA?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        Remember, even as a freshman, getting your name out there matters. If you interact with the same recruiter a few times over two years, they will start to remember you when it comes time for the formal interview.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">6. The Resume and Portfolio</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        It is always a good idea to have printed resumes ready. While many recruiters will eventually tell you to apply online, handing them a physical copy is a professional gesture.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        It looks even better if you carry these in a professional folder or leather folio. This gives you a place to keep your resumes crisp and provides a spot to collect the business cards or flyers the recruiters give to you.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        While going to a career fair is daunting, it is incredibly worthwhile. If you've never done it before, understand that it takes practice. Recruiters meet hundreds of unprepared students a day. By following these steps, you are already ahead of the curve.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 500;">
                        Most importantly, remember that recruiters are social people by nature; they are there because they want to meet you. Talk to a few people, and you will find your confidence growing with every booth you visit.
