                <div style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--text-dark);">
                    
                    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.7; color: var(--text-dark); margin-bottom: 2rem; font-weight: 500;">
                        Securing an internship as a first-year student is a challenging endeavor. I vividly recall my experience as a freshman at Bentley University when I visited the career service center for guidance on the internship search process. Rather than receiving support, I was met with laughter. The encounter left me feeling as though landing a professional role so early in my academic career was an impossibility.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        Fortunately, I chose to persevere. By staying vigilant and applying for a position the moment it was released, I secured a finance internship at a small facilities management company. While the initial dismissal from the career center was frustrating, it inspired me to help other freshmen achieve their professional goals. A freshman internship provides more than just a summer income; it builds the foundational resume experience necessary for competitive sophomore and junior year recruiting cycles.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Be Strategic with Your Applications</h2>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        The first rule of a successful search is to avoid applying to every available listing. In my early search, I wasted countless hours on applications that were never going to be considered, time that could have been better spent on academics or building a social network. If I were in that position today, I would focus exclusively on roles that explicitly state they accept freshman applicants.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        Utilize platforms like Handshake and LinkedIn to filter your search. If a job description specifies that the firm only recruits juniors, it is best to move on. Regardless of your credentials or achievements, internal corporate requirements often make those filters absolute. By focusing your energy on firms that are open to underclassmen, you ensure your efforts yield a higher return on investment.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Attend Career Fairs for Professional Development</h2>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        Despite what some may advise, attending career fairs as a freshman is an excellent opportunity. Even if immediate hiring is unlikely, these events allow you to practice professional communication and understand how to engage with recruiters before the stakes are higher in later years. You may even discover companies that offer specific programs tailored to first-year students.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        When attending, dress in professional attire and approach booths within your target industry, such as accounting or finance. Introduce yourself and inquire about freshman opportunities or ask for advice on how to become a competitive candidate in the future. While many recruiters may not have immediate openings, they are often willing to review your resume and provide industry-specific tips. You might also ask if they are aware of other firms that hire freshmen, which can be an invaluable source of leads.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Apply for Specialized Freshman and Diversity Programs</h2>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        Many large firms offer freshman-specific programs or diversity internships. These are often designed for students from underrepresented communities or those who have demonstrated a commitment to supporting such communities. All the Big Four accounting firms, as well as various investment banks and consulting groups, offer these initiatives.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        While these programs are sometimes shorter than a standard ten-week internship, they are prestigious opportunities to establish a relationship with a top-tier firm. Participants in these programs often receive early offers for the following summer. Many students who follow this path find themselves with junior year internships at leading global companies.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Leverage Personal and Professional Networks</h2>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        Networking remains one of the most effective ways to find an internship. If you have family members or acquaintances who work at small accounting or professional services firms, reach out to them. Small businesses often have more flexibility than large corporations and may be willing to create a position for a motivated student with a personal recommendation. Even if you do not have these connections, do not be discouraged; while they are helpful, they are not the only path to success.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        Furthermore, do not overlook the value of reaching out to upperclassmen and professors. When I shared my internship struggles with my accounting professor, he made a genuine effort to assist me. While that specific lead did not result in a job, it demonstrated that faculty members are often willing to support proactive students. When approaching a professor, ensure you have already built a strong rapport through active class participation. Approach them for general advice rather than directly asking for a job, as this is more professional and respectful of their time.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Start Early and Maintain Flexibility</h2>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        The most critical factor in your success is starting the process as early as possible. Beginning your search as soon as you arrive on campus maximizes your chances of finding an opening. However, if you feel you have started late, remain persistent. Many companies post last-minute opportunities well into the spring semester.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                        If you are unable to secure a traditional internship, consider working or volunteering for a nonprofit organization. This provides excellent professional experience and demonstrates the work ethic and skills that recruiters look for during sophomore and junior year recruiting.
                    </p>
